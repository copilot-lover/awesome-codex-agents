# Awesome Codex Agents - AI Development Team 🚀

**Supercharge Codex with a team of specialized AI agents** that work together to build complete features, debug complex issues, and handle any technology stack with expert-level knowledge.

## 🎯 The Problem & Solution

While Codex is powerful, complex projects need specialized expertise. Generic AI responses often miss best practices, leading to suboptimal code.

**Our solution:** A team of specialized AI agents that work together, each with deep expertise in their domain. Just like a real development team, but available 24/7.

## 💡 See The Difference

```
You: "Build user management"

Without Agent Team:
Codex: *Generic authentication implementation*

With Agent Team:
├── Tech Lead: "I'll coordinate this complex feature for your project"
├── Project Analyst: "Detected Django + React stack, assembling specialists"
├── Backend Expert: "Implementing authentication with Django patterns"
├── API Architect: "Designing RESTful resources with validation"
├── Frontend Dev: "Building React components with modern patterns"
└── Database Expert: "Optimizing queries and relationships"

Result: Production-ready implementation tailored to your stack
```

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**This project is experimental and token-intensive.** I'm actively testing these agents with a high-token Codex environment - expect high token consumption during complex workflows. Use with caution and monitor your usage.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Install the Agents
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijaythecoder/awesome-codex-agents.git
cp -r awesome-codex-agents/agents ~/.codex/
```

### 2. Configure for Your Project
Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
codex "Use team-configurator to set up my AI development team"
```

### 3. Start Building
```bash
codex "Build a complete user authentication system"
```

Your AI team will automatically use the right specialists for your tech stack!

## 🛠 Plug & Play with Codex
Copy the `codex` folder into your project root and merge `AGENTS.md` with your existing configuration. Codex will load agents from `codex/agents` automatically.


## 🎯 How Auto-Configuration Works

The team-configurator agent is your AI team setup expert. When invoked, it:

1. **Checks Existing Setup** - Looks for AGENTS.md and preserves your customizations
2. **Analyzes Your Stack** - Uses project-analyst to detect frameworks and patterns
3. **Scans Available Agents** - Discovers all agents in ~/.codex/agents/
4. **Creates Smart Mappings** - Routes tasks to the perfect specialist
5. **Updates AGENTS.md** - Saves configuration without removing existing content

### Three-Phase Orchestration

Your Tech Lead coordinates work through:
- **Research Phase** - Multiple specialists gather information in parallel
- **Planning Phase** - Creates tasks with TodoWrite, identifying dependencies
- **Execution Phase** - Agents work together, sharing context efficiently

Example output for a Django + React project:
```markdown
✅ Project Optimization Complete!

Detected Stack:
- Backend: Django 4.2 (Python)
- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL

Configured Specialists:
- API: @django-api-developer
- Backend: @django-backend-expert
- Frontend: @react-component-architect
- Database: @django-orm-expert

Your AI development team is ready!

## 🎬 Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Shopping Cart
```
You: "Add a shopping cart to my online store where users can add products, 
update quantities, and see the total price with tax calculation"

Tech Lead orchestrates:
→ Research: 
  • Project Analyst detects Laravel + Vue.js stack
  • Code Archaeologist examines existing product/user models
